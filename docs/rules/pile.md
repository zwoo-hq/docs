# Pile customizations

The contents of the pile can be fully customized in the "Cards pile" rule group inside the rules widget.

Inside this group you can choose the amount of cards of a certain type are inside the card pile. Because ZWOO simulates a real card pile, changes the amounts will effectively change to probability of a card to be drawn from the pile. 

Furthermore this feature can be used to disable certain types of cards by change the amount of those cards inside the pile to 0.

::: warning Attention
ZWOO will scale the contents of the card pile base on demand, this means that changing to amount of a certain card to **_n_** will be no guarantee that there are at most **_n_** cards of this type inside the game at any point of time.
