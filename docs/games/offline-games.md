Offline games are a special type of zwoo games that can be played without an internet connection. They are designed to be played by a single player against some bots. Offline games are a great way to pass the time when you don't have an internet connection.

## Restrictions

[Game profiles](./game-profiles.md) are currently not supported in offline games. This means that you cannot apply your game profiles to an offline game.
